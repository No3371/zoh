description: This workflow guides the creation of **Exploration** projex documents — comprehensive investigation of status quo, subject domains, or specific questions to build deep understanding and inform decisions. (This is part of @projex-framework skill. It is a MUST to load the skill first.)
---

## PURPOSE

Explorations provide thorough, grounded investigation into what exists, how it works, and why it matters. They build comprehensive understanding through systematic inquiry.

**Key characteristics:**
- Deep dive into existing systems, domains, or phenomena
- Comprehensive mapping of current reality
- Discovery-oriented investigation
- Foundation for informed decision-making

**Contrast with Evaluation and Proposal:**
- **Exploration** — anchored to the status quo: investigates what exists, how it works, and why
- **Evaluation** — open-ended: any question, idea, or solution; no fixed framing or direction
- **Proposal** — directional: explores a specific change or idea with trade-offs and approaches

---

## INVOCATION

```
/explore-projex.md <question or subject>
```

**Examples:**
- `/explore-projex.md How does our authentication system work?`
- `/explore-projex.md What are the patterns in our API design?`
- `/explore-projex.md Why do we have these caching layers?`
- `/explore-projex.md @src/core/engine.rs`
- `/explore-projex.md Should we adopt microservices?`

---

## EXPLORATION TYPES

### Domain Exploration
Comprehensive investigation of a subject area, system, or domain.

### Architectural Exploration
Deep dive into system structure, patterns, and design decisions.

### Decision Exploration
Research and analysis to inform a specific decision without proposing solutions.

### Question Exploration
Thorough investigation to answer a specific technical or strategic question.

### Historical Exploration
Tracing evolution, understanding why things are the way they are.

---

## WORKFLOW STEPS

### 1. FRAME THE EXPLORATION

Define scope and questions:

- What are we exploring?
- What question needs answering?
- What decision does this inform?
- How deep should we go?
- Who needs this understanding?

### 2. SCAFFOLD THE DOCUMENT

Create file: `{yyyymmdd}-{exploration-name}-explore.md` **before investigating anything**.

Fill in what you know so far — the header, guiding questions, scope, context — then identify **investigation targets**: the specific areas, components, files, or concepts you intend to dive into. Each target becomes a section under Investigation with a brief rationale for why it matters. The rest of the document (findings, patterns, answers) stays empty — it gets filled during the dives.

This scaffold is the working artifact. Everything learned goes into it, not into your context alone.

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
# [Exploration Title]

> **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Author:** [name or agent]
> **Type:** Domain | Architectural | Decision | Question | Historical
> **Related Projex:** [links]

### 3. DIVE INTO TARGETS

Work through investigation targets one at a time. For each target:

1. **Set status** to `In Progress` in the document
2. **Investigate deeply** — read code, trace flows, examine artifacts, follow references
3. **Write findings directly into the target's section** — not in your head, in the document. Include what you found, key observations, dependencies, surprises.
4. **Set status** to `Done`
5. **Reassess the target list:**
   - Did this dive reveal new areas worth investigating? → Add new targets
   - Did findings change what matters? → Reprioritize remaining targets
   - Did a pending target turn out irrelevant? → Mark `Dropped` with brief reason
6. **Repeat** for the next target

The document grows incrementally. If the user interrupts or the session ends, the exploration is partially complete but still useful — every finished target's findings are already captured.

**Do NOT synthesize or write final sections yet.** Complete all targets first.

### 4. REVISIT

**Mandatory second pass.** Only after every target from step 3 is `Done` or `Dropped`, revisit the exploration as a whole:

1. **Re-read the full document** from top to bottom — you now have context you lacked at the start
2. **Identify gaps** — are there areas that were shallow, connections that weren't traced, or questions the dives raised but didn't answer?
3. **Add new targets** for anything that warrants deeper investigation, mark them `Pending`
4. **Deepen existing targets** — if a completed target's findings feel thin now that you have the bigger picture, reopen it (`In Progress`) and expand
5. **Dive into all new/reopened targets** following the same procedure as step 3
6. Once all revisit targets are `Done`, proceed to synthesis

This pass exists because early dives happen with incomplete understanding. The agent sees the full picture only after finishing all initial targets — that is the right time to judge what's missing.

### 5. SYNTHESIZE

Once all targets (including revisit targets) are done:

1. Fill in **Patterns & History** — cross-cutting themes across targets
2. Fill in **Findings** — distill discoveries, build mental model, note implications
3. Fill in **Answers** — address each guiding question with evidence from the dives
4. Write the **Summary** — now that you have the full picture
5. Capture remaining unknowns in **Open Questions**

### 6. VALIDATE & FINALIZE

**Check:**
- [ ] All non-dropped targets have findings written
- [ ] Core questions answered with evidence
- [ ] Major components and relationships mapped
- [ ] Facts verified, assumptions marked
- [ ] Mental model is coherent

**Finalize:**
1. Front-load summary and key discoveries
2. Adjust detail to match scope
3. Link to related projex
4. Place in appropriate folder:
   - Active/referenced → `projex/`
   - Completed/reference → `projex/closed/`
   - Outdated → `projex/archived/`

## EXPLORATION PRINCIPLES

- **Curiosity-driven** — Follow interesting threads, ask "why" repeatedly
- **Grounded** — Verify against actual systems, test assumptions
- **Focused breadth** — Cover territory thoroughly within scope boundaries
- **Synthesis-oriented** — Connect pieces into coherent mental models
- **Neutral** — Understand before judging, describe without prescribing

## EXPLORATION VS EVALUATION VS PROPOSAL

| Aspect | Exploration | Evaluation | Proposal |
|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Anchored to** | Status quo | Any question/idea | A specific direction |
| **Focus** | What exists and why | Open-ended analysis | "What if we go this way?" |
| **Stance** | Neutral investigation | Adaptive — critical, comparative, or exploratory | Advocacy with honest trade-offs |
| **Output** | Knowledge map and insights | Findings and recommendations | Approach options and impact analysis |
| **When** | Need to understand current reality | Need to think deeply about something | Have a concrete idea to flesh out |

**Use Exploration when:**
- You need to understand how something works
- You're mapping existing territory to inform a decision
- Knowledge gaps prevent progress

**Use Evaluation when:**
- You want to deeply analyze a question, idea, or solution
- You're comparing alternatives or assessing viability
- You need open-ended research without a predetermined direction

**Use Proposal when:**
- You have a specific change or idea in mind
- You want to explore approaches, trade-offs, and impact for that direction
- You're building toward a decision to accept or reject

## OUTPUT

Produces exploration document at `projex/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-explore.md` with:
- Comprehensive understanding of subject
- Answers to guiding questions
- Foundation for informed decisions
- Links to related projex

---

## NOTES

- Explorations build understanding, not prescriptions
- Depth matches importance and complexity
- Use relative paths for repo files
- Can spawn Evaluations or Plans once understanding is built
