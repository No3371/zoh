description: This workflow guides the creation of **Walkthrough** projex documents — comprehensive records authored after every Plan execution. (This is part of @projex-framework skill. It is a MUST to load the skill first.)
---

## PURPOSE

Walkthroughs capture what actually happened during execution. They provide complete traceability, verify success criteria, and preserve insights for future reference.

**Key characteristics:**
- Complete record of execution outcomes
- Detailed file changes down to line numbers
- Success criteria verification with proof
- Lessons learned and pattern discoveries

---

## INVOCATION

```
/close-projex.md
```

**Timing:** Invoke when the projex is ready to close — all criteria satisfied AND closing is allowed (user instructed to close, or projex is marked auto-close). See execute-projex.md § CLOSING for the full protocol.

---

## PREREQUISITES

Before closing:

- [ ] Plan execution is complete (status is `Complete` or `Blocked`)
- [ ] User has reviewed and is satisfied — OR projex is marked `Auto-Close: Yes`
- [ ] All success criteria are verifiable
- [ ] Execution log/notes are available (including any post-plan user-directed actions)
- [ ] Currently on ephemeral branch `projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}`
- [ ] All execution changes are committed (including post-plan changes)

---

## WORKFLOW STEPS

### 1. GATHER EXECUTION DATA

Collect all information from the execution:

#### From the Plan
1. Original objectives
2. Success/acceptance criteria
3. Planned steps
4. Expected file changes

#### From Execution
1. What actually happened for each step
2. Any deviations from plan
3. Issues encountered and resolutions
4. Actual file changes made

#### From Verification
1. Test results
2. Verification outcomes
3. User feedback

### 2. DOCUMENT ACTUAL CHANGES

**IMPORTANT: Document what actually happened, not what was planned.** The walkthrough is a historical record of reality.

1. **Query git for actual changes:**

```bash
# List all commits in ephemeral branch
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# See all files changed
git diff --stat main..HEAD

# Get detailed diff
git diff main..HEAD
```

2. **For each file changed, record:**
   - File path
   - Change type (created/modified/deleted)  
   - Specific changes (line numbers, actual before/after)
   - Purpose of change
   - **Whether this matches or deviates from plan**

3. **Compare against plan:**
   - Files in plan but not changed → Document why (already done? not needed? blocked?)
   - Files changed but not in plan → Document why (discovered during execution? dependency?)
   - Changes different from plan → Document what and why

### 3. VERIFY SUCCESS CRITERIA

For each success criterion from the plan:

1. **State the criterion**
2. **Document verification method used**
3. **Record the evidence/proof**
4. **Mark pass/fail with notes**

### 4. CAPTURE INSIGHTS

Document learnings:

- **Lessons learned** — What would you do differently?
- **Pattern discoveries** — New patterns identified
- **Gotchas/pitfalls** — Traps encountered
- **Reusable knowledge** — Insights for future work

### 5. DRAFT THE WALKTHROUGH

Create a new file: `{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}-walkthrough.md`

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
# Walkthrough: [Plan Title]

> **Execution Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Completed By:** [name or agent]
> **Source Plan:** [link to plan document]
> **Duration:** [how long execution took]
> **Result:** Success | Partial Success | Failed

```

### Test Output
```
[Relevant test or verification output]
```

### References
- [Links to relevant commits, PRs, or documents]
```

### 6. FINALIZE DOCUMENTS

1. **Update the source plan:**
   - Change status to `Complete`
   - Add link to walkthrough

```markdown
> **Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Walkthrough:** [link to walkthrough document]
```

2. **Update related projex:**
   - Source proposal (if applicable)
   - Any dependent plans

3. **Move to closed folder:**
   - Move Plan document to `projex/closed/`
   - Place Walkthrough in `projex/closed/` alongside the Plan
   - If source Proposal exists and all derived Plans are closed, move Proposal to `projex/closed/` as well

4. **Commit walkthrough and file moves** — stage each moved/created file by explicit path:

```bash
git add projex/closed/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-walkthrough.md
git add projex/closed/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-plan.md
# If proposal also moved:
git add projex/closed/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-proposal.md
# Stage deletions from original locations (git tracks the move):
git add projex/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-plan.md
git commit -m "projex: close {plan-name} - add walkthrough"
```

---

### 7. FINALIZE GIT BRANCH

**CRITICAL: Execute each git command one at a time. Wait for completion and verify success before proceeding to the next command.**

The ephemeral branch must be finalized. Present options to user:

#### Option A: Squash Merge (Default/Recommended)
Combines all execution commits into a single clean commit on base branch.

```bash
# Step 1 - WAIT for completion, verify "Switched to branch 'main'"
git checkout main

# Step 2 - WAIT for completion, verify squash summary
git merge --squash projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}

# Step 3 - WAIT for completion, verify commit created
git commit -m "projex: {plan-name} - [summary of changes]"

# Step 4 - WAIT for completion, verify branch deleted
git branch -D projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}
```

**Best for:** Clean history, routine executions

#### Option B: Merge with History
Preserves full commit history from execution.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name} --no-ff -m "projex: merge {plan-name}"
git branch -d projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}
```

**Best for:** Complex executions where step-by-step history is valuable

#### Option C: Rebase and Merge
Replays commits onto base branch for linear history.

```bash
git checkout projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name} --ff-only
git branch -d projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}
```

**Best for:** Linear history preference, collaborative workflows

#### Option D: Abandon (Failed Execution)
Discards the branch without merging.

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D projex/{yyyymmdd}-{plan-name}
```

**Use when:** Execution failed, changes are not wanted

---

### Branch Finalization Decision Tree

```
Was execution successful?
├── Yes → Do you need step-by-step history?
│   ├── Yes → Option B (Merge with History)
│   └── No → Option A (Squash Merge) ← default
└── No → Are partial changes valuable?
    ├── Yes → Cherry-pick valuable commits, then Option D
    └── No → Option D (Abandon)
```

---

## WALKTHROUGH PRINCIPLES

### Completeness
- Document everything that happened
- Don't skip steps even if they went smoothly
- Include all file changes with specifics

### Traceability
- Link every change to a plan step
- Document deviations with reasoning
- Provide verifiable evidence

### Learning Capture
- Extract insights while fresh
- Document both failures and successes
- Make knowledge reusable

### Honesty
- Record actual outcomes, not desired ones
- Acknowledge what didn't work
- Document partial successes accurately

---

## OUTPUT

This workflow produces:
- A walkthrough projex document at `projex/closed/{yyyymmdd}-{name}-walkthrough.md`
- Source plan moved to `projex/closed/` with completion status and walkthrough link
- Source proposal moved to `projex/closed/` (if all derived plans are closed)
- Updated relationships in related projex documents
- **Ephemeral branch merged/deleted** — changes now on base branch

**Folder structure after close:**
```
projex/
├── [other pending projex...]
└── closed/
    ├── {yyyymmdd}-{name}-proposal.md   (if applicable)
    ├── {yyyymmdd}-{name}-plan.md
    └── {yyyymmdd}-{name}-walkthrough.md
```

**Git state after close:**
```
main (or base branch)  ← you are here, with all changes merged
  └── (ephemeral branch deleted)
```

## WALKTHROUGH QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before considering walkthrough complete:

- [ ] Every plan objective has outcome documented
- [ ] Every plan step has actual execution recorded
- [ ] All file changes listed with specifics
- [ ] All success criteria verified with evidence
- [ ] All deviations explained
- [ ] All issues documented with resolutions
- [ ] Key insights captured
- [ ] Source plan updated
- [ ] Related projex linked
- [ ] Plan and Walkthrough moved to `projex/closed/`
- [ ] Source proposal moved to `projex/closed/` (if all derived plans closed)
- [ ] **Ephemeral branch finalized** (merged or abandoned)
- [ ] **Back on base branch** with clean state

---

## NOTES

- Walkthroughs are historical records — don't edit them after completion
- Be thorough — you'll thank yourself when reviewing later
- Use relative paths when referencing repository files
- The value of projex compounds when walkthroughs are complete
- If execution was complex, write the walkthrough immediately while fresh
- **Squash merge is the default** — preserves clean history while capturing all changes
- Branch finalization is the final step — don't forget to delete the ephemeral branch
- The walkthrough commit should be the last commit before merge
